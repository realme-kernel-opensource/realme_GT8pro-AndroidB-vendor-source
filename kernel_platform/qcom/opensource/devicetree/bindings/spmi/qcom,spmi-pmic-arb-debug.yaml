description: |
  The SPMI PMIC Arbiter is found on various QTI chips.  It is an SPMI controller
  with wrapping arbitration logic to allow for multiple on-chip devices to
  control a single SPMI master.

  The PMIC Arbiter debug bus is present starting at arbiter version 5.  It has
  read and write access to all PMIC peripherals regardless of ownership
  configurations.  It cannot be used on production devices because it is
  disabled by an eFuse.
